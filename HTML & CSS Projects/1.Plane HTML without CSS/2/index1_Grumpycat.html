        <p> <strong>Tardar Sauce</strong> (April 4, 2012 â€“ May 14, 2019), nicknamed <strong>Grumpy Cat</strong>, was an
            American Internet celebrity
            cat. She was known for her permanently "grumpy" facial appearance, which was caused by an underbite
            and feline dwarfism. She came to prominence when a photograph of her was posted on September 22,
            2012, on social news website Reddit by Bryan Bundesen, the brother of her owner Tabatha Bundesen.

            subject of a popular Internet meme in which humorously negative, cynical images were made from
            photographs of her.</p>
